The day will run from 10:00am until 5:00pm, however feel free to come and go as you please.

## Food
Food on campus is scarce on weekends, so we recommend either ordering in food, or bringing something with you. There are a few corner-shops located nearby however. There's a [map of local food places](https://goo.gl/yYlfs5) to help you find nearby food.

## Electronics
As expected, you'll need to bring your robot to work on, in whatever state it may be. We also recommend bringing at least 1 laptop with you to work on. Laptops will be provided for you to use.

## Supervision
Team members must be accompanied by any adult who is able to take responsibility for all of them. (this would ideally be a teacher, but it can be a parent if all the other parents agree).
